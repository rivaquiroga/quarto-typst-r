# Crafting Custom and Reproducible PDF Reports with Quarto and Typst in R

This event is part of the Workshops for Ukraine 🇺🇦 series organized by Dariia Mykhailyshyna. 

🎟️ [Registration](https://sites.google.com/view/dariia-mykhailyshyna/main/r-workshops-for-ukraine)

## Preparing for the workshop

You will need recent versions of both Quarto and R: 

- R >= 4.2
- [Quarto >= 1.6](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

We will use the following packages: `quarto`, `knitr`, `tidyverse`, `showtext`.

## Agenda

During the workshop, we will work through three examples that will help us explore the YAML options in Quarto-Typst documents, the way Quarto raw blocks and divs work with Typst code, and the general logic of using templates.

- example-1_yaml.qmd
- example-2_blocks-divs.qmd
- example-3_templates.qmd


After the workshop, the edited version of each of these files will be uploaded to this repository.
